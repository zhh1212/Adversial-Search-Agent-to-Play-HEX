"""
Provide a class to maintain the state of a Cachex game board, including
some helper methods to assist in updating and searching the board.

NOTE:
This board representation is designed to be used internally by the referee
for the purposes of validating actions and displaying the result of the game.
Each player is expected to store its own internal representation of the board
for use in informing decisions about which action to choose each turn. Please
don't assume this class is an "ideal" board representation for your own agent; 
you should think carefully about how to design your own data structures for 
representing the state of a game, with respect to your chosen strategy.
